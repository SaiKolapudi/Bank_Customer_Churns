# Customer Churn Prediction for Union Bank of India

## Project Overview
This repository hosts a machine learning project aimed at predicting customer churn for Union Bank of India (UBI). It includes a detailed analysis within a Jupyter Notebook, the dataset used for the analysis, and a comprehensive report detailing the study's findings and recommendations.

## Repository Contents
- `UBI_Bank_Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with Python code for the entire analysis and predictive modeling process.
- `Churn_Modelling.csv`: The dataset used in the analysis, containing customer demographics, account details, and churn status.
- `Customer Churn Prediction of Union Bank of India_Report.docx`: A detailed report in DOCX format that outlines the methodology, analysis, and insights derived from the project.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The provided Jupyter Notebook contains an exploratory data analysis section that reveals valuable insights into factors contributing to customer churn at UBI.

## Feature Engineering
The project includes the creation of new features designed to improve the predictive models' performance, which are integral to the analytical approach detailed in the notebook.

## Predictive Modeling
The notebook outlines the development and evaluation of several predictive models, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gaussian Naive Bayes

Models are assessed based on accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC scores, with results visualized for better interpretability.

## Conclusions and Recommendations
The report document (`Customer Churn Prediction of Union Bank of India_Report.docx`) contains a summary of the project's findings and strategic recommendations for UBI to address the customer churn effectively.
